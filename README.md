The goal of this project was to compile a useful website with all the recent articles related to data science and machine learning from websites I like following. It was also an opportunity to demonstrate my skills in (1) live web scraping and (2) summarizing articles with Python/NLTK, and building a web app with Flask/Heroku. This one week project came together in early May/2018. This web app includes:

- Towards Data Science 
- Analytics Vidhya
- Kdnuggets (news)
- FiveThirtyEight (Riddler)
- PlayerFM (Data Science)

I would be happy if you contact me with any comments/suggestions! (mhan3141@gmail.com)



## A daily digest of recent data science article
When I am drinking my morning coffee, I like to catch up on the latest posts on some of my favorite sites. I found it helpful to compile those recent articles into a single blog, which include "Towards Data Science - Medium", "Analytics Vidhya", "Kdnuggets", "FiveThirtyEight", and "PlayerFM. I hope you also find this compilation helpful, and you make it part of your morning routine!
